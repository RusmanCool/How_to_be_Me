<h3><i>Follow these instructions below using resources identified in 
the <a href=section_2.html><b>Before You Begin</b></a> section</i></h3>
<ol>
<li>Let's skip the very first step on your way to be me, Sergey Sabirov. 
You just needed to be born in Russia to be me. As long as the time machine hasn't 
been invented yet, you will not be able to go back a few years ago and convince your 
parents that they need to move to Russia because life there is so much fun! 
However, it is true...

<p><li>But do not give up! You definitely can successfully accomplish the second 
step: <u>become an undergraduate student at Virginia Tech in the electrical engineering 
department.</u>
<br><br><i>*If you are already a student, please, skip this step and go to the step 3 
of this section.</i>
<br><br>You need to:
<br><br>

<ol type="I">
<li>Pass all the required standards tests such as SAT.
<li>Send your transcripts to VT admissions office.
<li>Fill out the application form on VT website.
<li>Submit your filled out application.
<li>Pay application fee.
<li>Secure funding (or maybe you already have money). The sooner, the better.
<li>Wait until the university sends you the acceptance letter.
<li>Locate an appropriate apartment with nice roommates.
</ol>
<br>*For more information refer to: <a href="http://www.admiss.vt.edu/">http://www.admiss.vt.edu/</a>

<p><li>As soon as you are a student, <u>you can register for the summer term.</u> 
In order to do so:</li>
<ol type="I">
<li>Please, go to Hokie SPA located at: <a href="https://banweb.banner.vt.edu/ssb/prod/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin">https://banweb.banner.vt.edu/ssb/prod/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin</a>.
<li>Register for Summer I and Summer II by following the instructions on the website.
</ol>

<p><li><u>To find a part-time job as a computer technician</u>, please, you need to:
<ol type="I">
<li>Join the listserv for engineering students (information about job openings is 
often spread through listserv).
<li>Prepare your CV or resume.
<li>Contact all locally available technician centers, stores 
(4Help at VT; Best Buy; PC Land etc.).
<li>Send out your CV or resume and wait.
</ol>

<p><li><u>To find a Russian girlfriend/boyfriend</u>, you just need to be lucky! 
Especially, here at VT. There are just a few Russian students on campus. 
However, these are tips that will increase your chances of a successful "hunt":
<ul>
<li>Hang out on campus as much as possible.
<li>Try to communicate with foreign students as often as you can.
<li>Join "the Russian Club at VT" Facebook group to find someone cute and Russian.
<li>Show your interest in the Russian culture and make sure you are invited to the next Russian party.
<li>Be confident and smile.
<li>No questions about "communism", "vodka" or "evil Putin" - that's an instant turn off.
</ul>

<p><li>My congratulations if you successfully finished step 5. 
That was not easy! Take a deep breath, relax a little and go ahead to ask your lovely Russian speaking partner to move in together.
<br><i>*This step, probably, will be much harder for females, but nothing is impossible.</i>
<ul>
<li>Cook a nice dinner and invite your date to your house (you can eat out somewhere at a nice place as well).
<li>Do not jump into this important conversation right away. Have fun and watch TV.
<li>Start the conversation and explain reasons why you want to live with him/her.
<li>Promise that you will do your best to work on your relationship.
<li>Be genuine!
</ul>

<p><li>Hope your 6 step is accomplished, and you, guys, on your way to pack 
things and move to your sweet nest together, or one of you can move in another's 
partner place. Whatever your choice is, here are the instructions on how to be 
technology addicted as I am:
<ul>
<li>Follow every major news site publishing materials about technology development and its novelties.
<li>Go from link to link, read as much as you can.
<li>Do not keep an eye on time, time passes quickly, no need to take care of that.
<li>Employ YouTube a lot: there is a whole lot of the most interesting technology relating videos.
<li>If your girlfriend/boyfriend says: "It's time to get back to homework", 
respond: "Just 5 more minutes". Keep replying with the same answer either until 
s/he stops reminding or when it is the really time to hurry up and get back to work.
<li>Remember: there is never too much information about your passion.
<li>After staying up late, you will, obviously, be knocked down till 1-2 p.m. 
When your beloved one says again: "Wake up! It's time to get back to homework", 
please, follow the instruction above and reply: "Just 5 more minutes". 
It works as perfect as for the example above.
</ul>

<p><li>Now it is time to go out! No, you do not want to go to the Hokie House to get 
a sip of the Long Island drink, while being surrounded by tipsy Hokie fellows. The best place 
to go out for a technology addict is to drive to <a href="www.nasa.gov/centers/wallops"> Wallops Flight Facility</a> and see a 
rocket launch. To do so:
<ol type="I">
<li>Use your navigator to drive to the point of interest.
<li>Allow yourself the least possible time. When I was driving there, I was so late 
that if there had been policemen on the road, I would have got so many tickets that 
my 2 month salary would not cover them all.
<li>Arrive there just 10 seconds before the launch.
<li>Run like hell to get as close as possible.
<li>Take your phone and start making pictures. Let your emotions rule:
scream because it is already in the air! But you are right on time!
<li>Do not be embarrassed by people around looking at you as if you are an 
alien who wants to see the rocket. How would you look at them if they were you?
</ol>
