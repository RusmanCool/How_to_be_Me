<h1><p align=center>Long Story Short: Step-by-Step Instruction on How to be a Real Russian Man 
<br>Sergey Sabirov during the Summer</p></h1>
<h3><i>Who is Sergey Sabirov? &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That's me. <img src="ushanka.jpg"></i></h3>
<p align=left-side> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am a Russian born male and I currently reside in the United 
State while working on my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at Virginia 
Tech. In order to finish my degree by May 2015, I enrolled in Summer I and Summer II 
terms. Thus, I do not have too much free time. During the summer I also work part-time
 as a computer technician in one of the computer stores in Blacksburg. I live with my 
 wonderful Russian girlfriend in a cozy house 3 minutes away from VT campus. I am mad 
 about everything relating to technology, engineering which is why I spend hours and 
 hours every summer day on reading and watching news about it. I gain a lot of 
 priceless knowledge about my passion at the expense of going to bed really late. 
 However, I am a night person, so it is not a big deal. Despite being quite busy, 
 I have already done some fun stuff during this hot season. For example, I went to 
 observe the rocket launch by NASA at the Virginia Wallops Flight Facility a few weeks ago.</p>
